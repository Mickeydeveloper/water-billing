**MEGA integration removed (2026-01-12)**

MEGA-related code and documentation were removed from this repository per project scope. The repository no longer includes MEGA-specific features (`mega-handler.js`, `/save-to-mega` endpoint) or MEGA documentation files. If cloud backup functionality is required in the future, please open an issue describing the provider and security approach.

For other project documentation, see README files and the main codebase.
